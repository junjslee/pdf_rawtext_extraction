<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Objectives</head><p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p><p>Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply Identify a demand curve and a supply curve Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity First let's first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they mean by supply, and then how demand and supply interact in a market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demand for Goods and Services</head><p>Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on needs and wants-if you have no need or want for something, you won't buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, from an economist's perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a person who does not have a drivers license has no effective demand for a car.</p><p>What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units that consumers would purchase at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home.</p><p>Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which we explain in the next module) are held constant. We can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>.1, a demand schedule. In this case we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period (for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). A demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.2, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes on the vertical axis. Economics is not math.) https://openstax.org/books/principles-microeconomics-3e/pages/3-1-demand-supply-and-equilibrium-in-markets-for-goods-and-services Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">3</ref>.1 shows the demand schedule and the graph in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.2 shows the demand curve. These are two ways to describe the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Price (per gallon)</head><p>Quantity Demanded (millions of gallons)</p><p>$1.00 800 $1.20 700 $1.40 600 $1.60 550 $1.80 500 $2.00 460 $2.20 420  The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. We graph these points, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand-the inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.</p><p>Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope down from left to right. Demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.</p><p>Confused about these different types of demand? Read the next Clear It Up feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLEAR IT UP</head><p>Is demand the same as quantity demanded?</p><p>In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity demanded refers to a (specific) point on the curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supply of Goods and Services</head><p>When economists talk about supply, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants for refining into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied-that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied-the law of supply. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 . 2 A</head><label>32</label><figDesc>Figure 3.2 A Demand Curve for Gasoline The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice</figDesc><graphic coords="2,18.00,411.00,576.00,308.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
